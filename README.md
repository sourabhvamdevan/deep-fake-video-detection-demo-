Step 1):-

Download the dataset given in the dataset folder using that kaggle link (it contains 50 fake and 50 real files)

Step 2):-

load the dataset path in the project4.ipynb file and then run each cell simultaneously, so after 20 epochs it will save the model as deepfake_detector_resnet_lstm.keras

Step 3):-

load the model in classify3.ipynb and then put the video path (given in the video folder you can pic any video) 

Step 4):-

now run the python file app.py then on the terminal you will find the development server link as http://127.0.0.1:5000
